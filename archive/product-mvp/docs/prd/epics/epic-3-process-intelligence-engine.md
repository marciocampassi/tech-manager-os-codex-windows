# Epic 3: Process Intelligence Engine

**Expanded Goal:** Build the AI-powered process agent that powers the `tmr process` command to process inbox files, categorizes them by type and entity, updates context summaries using CLI commands for token-optimized injection, extracts actionable tasks with urgency classification, and moves files to appropriate destinations. This epic delivers the core "transcript-to-context" value proposition and depends on Epic 2's complete CLI foundation.

## Story 3.1: Inbox Scanner and File Parser

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to scan and parse inbox files efficiently,  
**so that** the process command can handle them.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. `InboxService` class with methods: `scanInbox()`, `parseFile()`
2. Supports file types: `.txt`, `.md`, `.json`
3. Returns array of `InboxFile` objects with: filepath, content, timestamp
4. Handles edge cases: empty inbox, large files, malformed files
5. Sorted by timestamp (oldest first)
6. Unit tests cover various file types and scenarios

## Story 3.2: AI-Powered Categorization Logic

**As a** manager,  
**I want** notes automatically categorized and filed,  
**so that** I don't have to manually organize everything.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. `CategorizationService` class with method: `categorize(file, context)`
2. AI prompt analyzes file and returns structured JSON:
   - Type: `1on1_session`, `feedback_positive`, `feedback_constructive`, `pip_concern`, `project_status`, `project_risk`, `team_meeting`, `leadership_meeting`, `candidate_interview`, `general_note`
   - Members: Array of member names mentioned
   - Projects: Array of project names mentioned
   - Insights: Key points for each entity
   - Destinations: Array of file paths
   - Suggested actions: Follow-up items
3. Handles ambiguous cases (low confidence triggers review)
4. Unit tests with mocked AI responses
5. Integration test with real file samples

## Story 3.3: Context Summary Updates via CLI Injection

**As a** manager,  
**I want** context summaries intelligently updated using CLI commands,  
**so that** I have current, accurate context without token-heavy file reading operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. `ContextService` class with method: `updateContext(email, insights)`
2. Instead of reading full context files, executes CLI commands:
   - For team members: Uses Epic 2 CLI to append insights
   - For projects: Updates project context via CLI
   - For relationships/leadership: Updates via CLI
3. AI generates insights from new notes
4. CLI handles section parsing and atomic updates
5. Token optimization: AI only generates insights, doesn't manipulate files
6. Unit tests with mocked CLI execution
7. Integration tests validate context updates

## Story 3.4: Task Extraction and Timeline Classification

**As a** manager,  
**I want** actionable tasks extracted and classified by urgency,  
**so that** I know what needs attention today vs. this week vs. later.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. `TaskService` class with method: `extractTasks(files, existingTasks)`
2. AI identifies tasks and classifies:
   - TODAY: Urgent, "ASAP", explicit today deadline
   - THIS WEEK: "This week", "by Friday", week deadlines
   - THIS MONTH: Monthly goals, month deadlines
   - THIS QUARTER: Quarterly objectives
3. Each task includes: description, owner, urgency reason, status
4. Updates existing task files (merges with current tasks)
5. Marks completed tasks based on mentions
6. Unit tests with task extraction scenarios

## Story 3.5: File Organization and Movement

**As a** developer,  
**I want** files moved to correct destinations after categorization,  
**so that** the workspace stays organized.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. `FileOrganizationService` with method: `organizeFile(file, destinations)`
2. Moves files from inbox to destination(s)
3. Creates destination directories if needed
4. Handles multi-destination cases (copy to multiple locations)
5. Archives unprocessable files to `archive/`
6. Atomic operations (no data loss)
7. Unit tests cover various organization scenarios

## Story 3.6: `tmr process` Command Implementation

**As a** leader,  
**I want** one command to process all inbox files,  
**so that** my workspace stays current with minimal effort.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. `tmr process` orchestrates: Scan → Categorize → Update Contexts → Extract Tasks → Organize Files
2. Progress indicators for each phase
3. Summary output:
   - Files processed
   - Contexts updated (people, projects)
   - Tasks extracted
   - Suggested actions
4. Handles errors gracefully (partial progress saved)
5. Optional flags: `--dry-run`, `--verbose`
6. Integration test validates full process workflow

## Story 3.7: `tmr watch` Command for Auto-Processing

**As a** leader,  
**I want** inbox to be processed automatically when files are added,  
**so that** I don't have to remember to run process.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. `tmr watch` monitors `inbox/` directory
2. Uses `chokidar` for file watching
3. Debounces multiple file additions (waits 5 seconds)
4. Runs `tmr process` automatically
5. Displays activity log
6. Can be stopped with Ctrl+C
7. Stores PID in `.system/watch.pid`
8. Integration test validates file watching
